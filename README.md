# Real-Time Broadcast Communication with Angular and .NET using SignalR

This repository contains the full-stack implementation of real-time broadcast communication using an Angular frontend and a .NET backend with SignalR.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates how to establish real-time communication between an Angular application and a .NET Core backend using SignalR. It covers the setup, configuration, and integration of SignalR to enable real-time messaging, suitable for applications like chat systems, live notifications, and collaborative tools.

## Key Technologies

- **Angular**: Frontend framework for building dynamic web applications.
- **.NET Core**: Backend framework for creating scalable web applications.
- **SignalR**: Library for enabling real-time web functionality.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm**: Required for the Angular frontend.
- **Angular CLI**: To manage Angular projects.
- **.NET SDK**: Required for the .NET backend.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `RealTimeAngular` directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Update the `environment.ts` file with your backend's URL and port.

4. Run the Angular development server:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `RealTimeDotNet` directory.
2. Restore the required NuGet packages:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Build and run the .NET project:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

### Running the Application

- Ensure both the Angular frontend and the .NET backend are running.
- Open multiple browser tabs at `http://localhost:4200/` to observe real-time broadcast communication in action.
